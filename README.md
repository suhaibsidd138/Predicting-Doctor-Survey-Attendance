# Predicting-Doctor-Survey-Attendance

Let me break down the assignment:

1. You have a dataset with doctor NPIs (unique identifiers) along with details like specialty, region, login/logout times, and engagement metrics
2. You need to build a web application that:
   - Takes a time input from the user (e.g., 6:00)
   - Predicts which doctors are most likely to attend a survey at that time
   - Returns the list of recommended NPIs as an Excel/CSV file
3. The solution should use AI/ML algorithms for prediction
4. The deadline is March 15th (today)

Let's approach this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Data Exploration and Analysis
First, we should download and analyze the dataset to understand the patterns and features that might predict survey participation.

## Step 2: Feature Engineering
We'll need to extract relevant features from the data, especially around time patterns.

## Step 3: Model Development
We'll build an ML model to predict the likelihood of survey participation based on the input time.

## Step 4: Web Application Development
Finally, we'll create a web application with an interactive UI.

Since I don't have direct access to the dataset link provided in your PDF, I'll create a solution framework that you can implement with your dataset. I'll provide:

1. Python code for data processing and model training
2. A simple web application implementation
3. Instructions for deployment

Would you like me to proceed with developing this solution? Also, would you be able to share any details about the dataset structure or provide a sample of the data so I can make the solution more specific?


# How to Run the Doctor Survey Prediction System

To run this code, you'll need to follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python (3.7+) if you don't already have it
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask
```

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Create a new project directory** and place the complete code you received into a file named `app.py`

2. **Place your dataset** in the same directory and name it `npi_data.csv` or update the `DATA_PATH` variable in the code to match your actual data path:
   ```python
   DATA_PATH = 'path/to/your/data.csv'  # Replace with your actual data path
   ```

3. **Training the model**: The first time you run the application, you'll need to train the model with your data. Add the following code at the end of the `app.py` file (before running it for the first time):

   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       # Train and save the model if it doesn't exist
       if not os.path.exists(MODEL_PATH):
           print("Training model...")
           df = load_and_prepare_data(DATA_PATH)
           model = build_model(df)
           save_model(model, MODEL_PATH)
           print("Model training complete!")
       
       # Run the Flask app
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface** by opening a browser and navigating to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

6. **Using the interface**:
   - Enter a time in 24-hour format (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)
   - Click "Predict Participation"
   - View the preview of the top 5 doctors
   - Download the full results as a CSV file

## Deployment Options

For submission purposes, you can deploy this application to make it publicly accessible:

1. **Heroku**:
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies
   - Create a `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn app:app`
   - Deploy to Heroku using their CLI or GitHub integration

2. **PythonAnywhere**:
   - Upload your files
   - Set up a web app pointing to your Flask application

3. **Google Cloud Run** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile`
   - Deploy as a containerized application

## Troubleshooting

- **If you get errors about missing columns**: Make sure your dataset has all required columns (NPI, Login Time, Logout Time, Time spent, Count of Attempts)
- **Datetime conversion errors**: Ensure your date/time columns are in a format that pandas can parse
- **Model accuracy issues**: You might need to adjust the target variable definition in `load_and_prepare_data()` based on your specific dataset

Would you like more detailed instructions for any particular part of the setup process?
