# Predicting-Doctor-Survey-Attendance

Let me break down the assignment:

1. You have a dataset with doctor NPIs (unique identifiers) along with details like specialty, region, login/logout times, and engagement metrics
2. You need to build a web application that:
   - Takes a time input from the user (e.g., 6:00)
   - Predicts which doctors are most likely to attend a survey at that time
   - Returns the list of recommended NPIs as an Excel/CSV file
3. The solution should use AI/ML algorithms for prediction
4. The deadline is March 15th (today)

Let's approach this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Data Exploration and Analysis
First, we should download and analyze the dataset to understand the patterns and features that might predict survey participation.

## Step 2: Feature Engineering
We'll need to extract relevant features from the data, especially around time patterns.

## Step 3: Model Development
We'll build an ML model to predict the likelihood of survey participation based on the input time.

## Step 4: Web Application Development
Finally, we'll create a web application with an interactive UI.

Since I don't have direct access to the dataset link provided in your PDF, I'll create a solution framework that you can implement with your dataset. I'll provide:

1. Python code for data processing and model training
2. A simple web application implementation
3. Instructions for deployment

Would you like me to proceed with developing this solution? Also, would you be able to share any details about the dataset structure or provide a sample of the data so I can make the solution more specific?
